# Scripts

Code to migrate Bugzilla (version 4.0.2) to GitHub issues
and other stuff that happened after that.

# Introduction
So first I build bugzilla2github.py.
Soon after I build AddIssuesToProject.py
Next I build FindCommitForIssue.py 

All script shave their own md file with some explanation.
