#FindCommitForIssue

##Introduction
While cleaning up old open issues I find issues 
that have been fixed but are still open.

So I want to list all cards in my Cleanup project that
reference issues issues, then find the original Bugzilla 
ID number, and search git commit logs if that number is mentioned.
