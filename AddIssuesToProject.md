#AddIssuesToProject

## Introduction
After building the bugzilla2github script I needed to add all 
issues to a project called "Cleanup" for further processing.

After I learned about GitHub's pagination of output I deciced
that it would not the greatest code ever. I just needed it to run once,
so I just looped it 5 times and it worked. \0/

That's it.
